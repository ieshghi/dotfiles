Repository to keep track of changes to bashrc and vimrc that I would like to have
across all server accounts. The only submodule necessary to update is the vundle
plugin for vim, but a general command is

$ git submodule foreach git pull origin master

to update changes to master repos of submodules. To update vim options just run
BundleInstall in vim to make sure plugins are up to date and also follow plugin
docs for any requiring special treatment.
