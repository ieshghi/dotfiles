Repository to keep track of changes to zshrc and nvim and other setups
that I would like to have across all server accounts.

To put into operation on a new machine:

1. Clone this repository into a directory called dev in the home directory.
2. Install `zsh` and `neovim` globally.
3. Install the pyenv prerequisites from here: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/common-build-problems
3. Then, run the `get_setup.sh` script using bash.
